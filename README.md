# ACPI DSDT patches for Lecoo Pro 14 (Linux)

🇷🇺 [Russian Readme here](README_RU.md)

DSDT dump and patch set for **Lecoo Pro 14 (N155A)**.
This patch addresses the following issues:
- Fixes the bug where the laptop reboots instead of powering off in Linux ([Shutdown turns into Reboot](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1108499&st=3420#entry141777966))..
- Unlocks the **S3 state** (Suspend to RAM), [although it likely does not work on the hardware level](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1108499&st=3340#entry141732975).
- Fixes **buffer overflow issues** for WMI methods.
- Resolves "ACPI ...device not found" errors during system boot.
- Fixes the "instant wake" issue for the S4 state (hibernation).


### ⚠️ Important

The `acpi_override` file must be loaded **BEFORE** the main initramfs image.
- **Secure Boot:** This patch will likely **not work** out-of-the-box if Secure Boot is enabled. Loading custom ACPI tables under Secure Boot requires complex manual signing and enrolling of your own keys. It is highly recommended to disable Secure Boot, otherwise, you are on your own to configure it.


## Preparation

1. Download the **`acpi_override.cpio`** file from the [Releases](https://github.com/LaVashikk/lecoo-linux-acpi-fix/releases) section.
2. Copy it to the root of your boot partition (usually `/boot`).

```bash
sudo cp acpi_override.cpio /boot/

```

Next, follow the instructions for your specific bootloader.



## Method 1: Systemd-boot (Arch, Pop!_OS)

1. Locate your bootloader configuration file. It is usually found in `/boot/loader/entries/` and has a `.conf` extension (e.g., `arch.conf` or `linux.conf`).
2. Open it for editing:
```bash
sudo nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
```

3. Add the line `initrd /acpi_override.cpio` **BEFORE** the main initramfs line.
**Example of how it should look:**
```text
title   Arch Linux
linux   /vmlinuz-linux
initrd  /acpi_override.cpio      # <-- override MUST be first!!
initrd  /initramfs-linux.img
options root=UUID=... rw
```

4. Save the file (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`) and close it (`Ctrl+X`).
5. Done. Reboot.

## Method 2: GRUB (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)

For GRUB, it is better to use a special variable so the settings persist after kernel updates.

1. Open the GRUB configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

2. Find the `GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM` variable.
* **If it exists:** Add our file to it.
* **If it doesn't exist:** Add the line to the end of the file:


```bash
GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM="acpi_override.cpio"
```
*(Note: The path is relative to the /boot root. If it doesn't work, try `"/boot/acpi_override.cpio"`).*

3. Update the GRUB configuration:
* **Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

* **Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo update-grub
```

## How to verify the patch is working

After rebooting, open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep ACPI | grep override
```

You should see lines similar to:

```text
ACPI: Table Upgrade: override [DSDT-ALASKA-  A M I ]
ACPI: DSDT 0x00000000969E3000 Physical table override, new table: 0x000000009B5A5000
```

If these lines are present, the patch has been applied successfully. Try shutting down the laptop to test the fix.
